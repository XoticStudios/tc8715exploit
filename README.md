# tc8715exploit
access the telnet of the technicolor tc8715 router for a couple of seconds at startup

note: you need python 3 x64 and need pwntools inorder for this to work
to get pwntools
pip install pwntools

the username and password to login to the router is currently unknown, but if anyone knows it, that would be great.
